iTunes-Searcher
================

Description
-----------

- The first section of the App was developed using TDD (this has been reused from a previous technical task due to time constraints).
- The App searches for artist names matching the search terms entered 2 seconds after the user has finished typing.
- NSURLSession provides a simple caching mechanism.
- This App was completed in around 2.5 hours due to this some corners have been unfortunately cut.


Future Improvements
-------------------

- Unit test remainder of code.
- Animate the loading of each cells image.
